# BECCA (Breast Cancer Care App)

Breast Cancer Support app made for CAST hackathon

### What is it?
It’s an app to help women who have just finished their treatment for breast cancer, which could include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy

### Why are we building it?
After finishing hospital-based treatment, women often experience feelings of isolation, loss and low mood. They have told us that it can be a real struggle to adjust to life after breast cancer; and whilst others expect them to quickly get ‘back to normal’, in reality they are facing lots of ongoing issues that can have a real impact on their emotional well-being. These could include,  changed body image, fatigue, early-onset menopause (triggered by medication) and fear of the cancer coming back.

### The product
This will be a tool that gives daily prompts, or cards, of activities  to give structure to a user’s day, boost their mood, normalise their experience and encourage healthy behaviours.
